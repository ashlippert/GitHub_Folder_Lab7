# GitHub Folder Sync BAE 305 - Lab 7

Author: Ashlyn Lippert

The purpose of this lab was to set up GitHub desktop, install Visual Studio Code, and connect these softwares together through syncing folders.

Git is a version control system that tracks code changes and enables collaboration without overwriting work. GitHub adds cloud storage, remote access, and project management tools, while GitHub Desktop simplifies the workflow with a visual interface.
